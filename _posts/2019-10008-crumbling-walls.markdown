### A Hypothetical Journey
Travel with me for a moment.  We'll go backwards in time a few decades, and across the sea:  The year is 1987, and you find yourself surrounded by a crowd of people in West Berlin.  In front of you is The Wall.  The dividing line between the free world, and an oppressive regime.  The President of the United States, Ronald Reagan is here, and is about to give a speech.  You can feel the anticipation in the air around you, and though you don’t know it:  this is a speech that was never supposed to happen.  The President was at an economic summit in Europe when his plans were changed to stop in Berlin.  The speech his writers presented to him was rejected by the US National Security Council and the State Department for being _“needlessly provocative”_ and likely to _“raise false hopes”._  Fortunately for history, the President has decided to give it anyways. [1]

Being a traveler from the future you don’t remember when the wall was built, nearly 30 years ago.  But the people around you do. And they miss their loved ones whom they’ve been separated from.  Today though, on the 12th of June 1987 you feel that something significant is about to happen.

As you stand there you imagine how Reagan must feel as he stands in front of the wall.  As he prepares to speak, you wonder what the people around you think of.  Perhaps they are thinking of the stories the wall has accumulated over the past 27 years of its existence.  

### But what exactly do they think?

They think perhaps, of people like the Strelczyk and Wetzel families, who became famous overnight for successfully and secretly constructing a hot air balloon and sailing themselves and their families through the air over the wall, and into the free world one chilly night? [2]  They think of people like Regina and Eckhard Albrecht, Two lovers separated by politics and war, who smuggled letters to each other under the scrutiny of the secret police, until Regina made a daring escape to the free West. [3]  They think of these, and the hundreds of others who have attempted to cross the border, often paying with their lives for a chance at freedom.

I imagine that the president and those in the crowd thought of the hundreds of people listening on both sides of the wall.  And the unique chance Reagan now had to stand in front of a piece of concrete and mortar that represented so many triumphs and tragedies.

### Admonitions proved prophetic
As you feel this sense of awe at the history you’re about to witness you wonder to yourself:  Are the dust, rocks, and materials of a certain site somehow more significant because of the events that transpired there, and the people that they transpired around?  Does one small speck of earth somehow know that once, something extraordinary happened on it?

Your visit puts a story from a history book into context and establishes a vision of what it was like.  And you experience firsthand that history is not made up of facts and dates, it is made up of lives, and words.  And today, the words of the president will alter history as he addresses the leader of the Soviets directly: 

He stands up and gives a speech that stirs your heart and reminds you of all that’s happened surrounding the divide in Germany, until he comes to the famous lines:
> “General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” [4]

As a time traveler you have a unique perspective on history.  And as you return home and review, you know that Reagan’s admonition to Gorbachev proves prophetic, that two years from now the Soviets will loosen the travel restrictions on the border, and that East and West Berliners alike will rush with sledgehammers in hand to finally bring the wall crumbling to pieces. [5]

I remember my mother telling me how a West German student in one of her high school classes expressed disbelief when the teacher rushed in and announced that the Berlin Wall had fallen.  To put this in perspective, it’s as if in the year 1990 a foreign country built a wall through one half of New York City and the wall had only come down today. 

If there’s one thing you remember from Reagan’s speech it’s this: What we choose to say about our freedoms now has impact.  Be willing to say it.  Whether that’s to our country, our city, or — dare I say — even to our university.


Reagan’s address was considered controversial, daring even.  But Reagan was willing to say it in a calm and firm way.  Unlike the pandering and bickering we so often see in today's political discourse.  Reagan said what needed to be said, and after great efforts to establish good will with the Soviets, it paid off.
 
### Today
As you think back on your journey you ponder existing borders and divisions in the world today.  You think of the border between North and South Korea, another border that separates a nation into regime and a democratic society.  You note with irony that the most recent significant Westerner to cross that border, is someone who’s pretty fond of walls himself.  You think of the political divides in our own country, and the walls that we metaphorically surround ourselves with due to our own squabbles concerning the way our country is run.
 
As the 2020 elections approach and infighting among our own citizens becomes so easy, let’s make this a time when the figurative walls that divide our own nation crumble.  Let’s reach across our own walls and make our society one that is united even in the midst of disagreements.
 
Reagan spoke about what he believed, even when it was controversial.  He stuck to his beliefs, but still reached out in solidarity and respect to Gorbachev.  And in doing so, he was able to push a wall to crumble. 
 
I hope that we can all do the same.
