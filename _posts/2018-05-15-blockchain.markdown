When you go to a store or shop online, the information about your account, how much money you have, and who it should be processed with go through a central authority like a bank.  If you and I wish to exchange money with one another, we must rely on a third party.  This works fine if we both agree to trust that third party.

But what about when that third party fails?  As much as banks go through the best efforts to be secure.  They aren’t perfect.  They are run by humans, humans make mistakes, and humans can be tricked.  A certain amount of fraud is expected in any given financial institution.  It’s just a fact of life, and people plan around it.

Now, what if you and I could exchange currency without trust in a third party?  What if we could have a transaction where there would be no risk of bounced checks, misinformation about funds, or reliance on a third party to verify and process this information?

In 2008 a white paper was posted on an online forum by a user who called him or herself Satoshi Nakamoto.[1]   This post detailed a digital asset that could be used as a currency, and would have a significant effect on the world of finance and computer science as we know it.  And most significantly, could be used without reliance on any central authority like a bank or government.  This paper of course, was about a technology we know today as “Bitcoin”.

Bitcoin is significant for two reasons:  1. It relies on a distributed ledger system 2. It solves something known as the double spending problem.  And it does those two things using something called a Blockchain.  Let’s talk about those three things:

#### Distributed ledgers:

Remember our example about trusting a third party?  Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin alleviate the need for a third party like a bank because they use something called a “distributed ledger”.  Let’s talk about what a normal ledger is first.  A ledger is like a journal of transactions, money you gained and money you spent.  It’s usually kept by a central authority, like a bank and consulted when we need to make a transaction.   Cryptocurrency works a bit differently.  The ledger for every transaction ever is stored  with every user of the bitcoin network.  Anytime you want to spend a coin, or receive one you and the other user of the network make a record of your transaction and submit it to the network.  Once the entire network reaches consensus on the transaction, it’s added to the community’s ledger.  All this without the need of one central authority, every user of the network is that authority.[2]  This is a nice idea, that breaks down because of something called _the double spending problem._

#### The double spending problem

Imagine I give you a piece of digital information.  I tell you that this piece of information is unique and that only you possess it, and that you may spend it like money.  An opportunistic and unethical mind might realize the flaw in this system.  Namely, that since this is virtual information and easily copyable, there is nothing to prevent you from spending that same coin more than once.  This is known as the double spending problem, and was a significant hurdle for the world of cryptographic currency.[3]  The concept of bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto proposed in his white paper solves this problem.  But to understand how, you first need to understand the technology that drives cryptocurrency called a Blockchain.

#### Blockchains
A blockchain consists of a chain of outputs from something known as a cryptographic hashing algorithm.  Hashing algorithms are conceptually quite simple.  They are algorithms that take any input, and produce a summary of that input.  The outputed summary is known as the hash, or checksum.  It looks something like this: The string `Utah Valley University` is summarized as `f91073dfd0b7967d124137a8961f3aea7c1d9ac89a749a8ff0dd57116da6888d` (Using the SHA-256 algorithm)  That summary is called a block.[4]

The “chain” part of the block consists of taking a new piece of information that includes another block, and creating a summary of that.  That way each new block you create has a reference buried inside it of the previous block.   Hence, a block-chain.

Since this blockchain ledger is distributed among many people, this eliminates a need for a central banking authority to verify transactions as limited while solving the problem of double spending, because each transaction is recorded in the ledger. 

### Why should you care?
Cryptocurrency is one application of blockchain technology.  It allows zero-trust transactions.  It has the capability of reforming the way we do finance, and greatly reducing fraud.  More exciting than this though are further applications of blockchain technology.   Using blockchains we will be able to have more secure and reliable voting, enforce social and legal contracts with no reliance on a central or intermediary authority, and distribute information free from tampering or censorship.[5[


When the white paper detailing bitcoin was first published, it started a revolution and upheaval as large as the one the internet created in the 1990s.  With it will come a disruption of the way we use technology.  All this has been done by taking existing known concepts and tools, and applying them in a new way.  Blockchain technology will significantly alter the way our world works in a new and exciting way.
