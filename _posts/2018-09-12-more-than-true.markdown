_(Literacy Narrative written for English 1010)_

Somehow stories make things better. Nights spent with my dad reading Harry Potter by the light of his saltwater tank form some of the early memories of my childhood.  I would sit there, watching the coral and the swimming fish as my dad painted a picture for me of a young boy who was whisked away to a magical world, which in a similar way is what happened to me as I listened.
Frustration was an emotion inherent in these nights spent reading.  Imagine my chagrin at being told that Harry was whisked away via portkey, that dark lord had returned, and that oh look isn’t it about time for bed?  It drove me crazy. This frustration is to what I attribute my motivation in learning to read well.  I just wanted to find out what happened next.


We would often spend evenings as a family reading some book or another.  We must have read Narnia a half dozen times,  and every year we would (attempt) to read The Halloween Tree by Ray Bradbury.  Bradbury had a way with words.  He could take the most mundane things and describe them in the most compelling way.  Bradbury could take an autumn day, and light it on fire.  He could make the world so small you could hold it cupped in your hands, or make it so big you felt like you’d fall into it.  His narrative didn’t walk, it ran.  And I think it was from him that I learned the power of the written word to alter my perception on the world.
There’s magical quality that permeates written words. Writing things legitimizes them.  It’s sometimes terrifying to see your own written words on a page, it’s like seeing your own soul laid bare before the world.  The thoughts that go on inside our heads are shifting and transitory, like mist.  But when they’re written, the mist turns to stone and it remains a permanent part of the world.  In this way, the words we use can end up shaping reality, rather than describing them. 


For example,  “crow” is an ugly word for a beautiful bird.  We tend to think of ravens as picturesque because the word itself is beautiful.  The stories I read when I was young have had a profound influence on the way I approach life, and children’s stories especially are important.  
However, if the greatest benefit of stories and words can be named, I would call it empathy for other people.  Stories  take you through a struggle that you will never experience, and this allows you to appreciate what other people are going through in real life.  The greatest benefit I’ve received from the stories I read was the experience of walking two miles in someone else’s shoes.  


G.K. Chesterton once said that _“Fairy Tales are more than true, not because they tell us dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten”_.  And this is what I have always taken away from stories.  Stories - truth be told - are completely ridiculous.  Reality obviously doesn’t work the way it does in stories,  but stories give us a platonic ideal of good and evil that we don’t find elsewhere.  Stories aren’t true.  The real world is more complicated, and while stories often capture that complexity, the ones that have shaped me are the ones that show good remaining good in the face of evil.


I’ve come a long way since my first book, and I’ve found out what happened next in many stories.  But if they could all be distilled into a single thought, it would be this.  That dragons can be beaten. Children’s stories like Harry Potter may seem trite and insignificant upon a cursory examination, but I continue to read children’s stories because I’m afraid of the adult I might become otherwise.
