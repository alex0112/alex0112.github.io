_(Written for COMM 1010)_

In 2004, 17% of state prisoners and 18% of federal inmates said they committed their current offense to obtain money for drugs.[1]  According to drugabuse.gov “Abuse of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drugs is costly to our Nation, exacting more than $740 billion annually in costs related to crime, lost work productivity and health care.”[2]  I think we can all agree that drug abuse is a bad thing, both for individuals and for society.  Today though, I’d like to talk about why our current approach to the drug problem is not working.  And how other effective strategies may be implemented.  Today I will present an argument as to why the current strategy for combating the drug problem - namely, making them illegal - is not effective, and is having a negative impact upon society.

In the early 1920s prohibition was put into place.  Prohibition was the time period when alcohol was illegal  in the United States.[3]   You’ve probably heard the term “speakeasy” before. A speakeasy was an illegal bar in the 20s and 30s.  Ever heard of Al Capone?  He’s a famous gangster who profited and became powerful from selling illegal alcohol.[3]  When alcohol was outlawed, there was a bit of a drop in alcohol consumption,  but by the year 1925 the number of speakeasies in New York City alone was estimated to be from 30,000 to 100,000.[4] A situation that lent power and wealth to the criminal class of the city.[3]

A similar situation can be seen today with drug abuse.  Illicit substances are in the hands of cartels and people who work in the wrong side of the law.  This is largely bad, for two reasons: First: It contributes to the growth of illicit drug markets, putting power into the hands of criminals.  And Second: That these under the counter and non-regulated markets contribute to the spread of dangerous diseases like HIV, AIDS, and Hepatitis C.

### Illicit drug markets
First let’s talk about illicit drug markets:  Drug abuse will exist regardless of whether or not it is legal, the same way that alcohol consumption did not cease in the 1920s. That’s just a fact of life.  Outlawing the problem - unfortunately - does not make it magically disappear.

If certain low level drugs were legalized, they could be treated the same way that tobacco and alcohol are treated today.  They could be taxed, regulated, and consumption could be controlled in a safer way than through back alley deals or non-sterile needles.


### Spread of disease
Another major problem of drug abuse in America is the spread of disease.  HIV, AIDs, and Hepatitis C are all diseases that can be spread by the sharing of used needles - something all too prevalent among users of injected drugs.  According to The National Center for Biotechnology:
“Injection drug users constitute the largest group of persons infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the United States, and most new infections occur in drug users. Controlling hepatitis C in the U.S. population, therefore, will require developing, testing, and implementing effective prevention and treatment strategies for persons who inject drugs” [5]

### The Solution
The solutions to these problems will need to be creative ones.  According to the Harm Reduction Journal “Vancouver, Canada opened a pilot medically supervised safer injecting facility (SIF), where [Injection Drug Users] can inject pre-obtained illicit drugs under the supervision of medical staff.”[6]  While this is certainly unorthodox this experimental treatment of the drug epidemic helps ensure that sterile needles are used, and that overdoses are avoided or dealt with.
Certain drugs could be legalized, taxed, and regulated with the goal of protecting and educating the population about the health risks of these substances rather than leaving the power of addictive substances in the hands of criminals.
By criminalizing the use of drugs we deter people who would seek rehabilitation and help.  We should focus our efforts on treating addictions rather than penalizing the addicted.
If making things illegal made them go away, then making harmful substances illegal would be a good solution.

The question we often ask ourselves is something like “Would I want my daughter or son to do something like heroin?” But perhaps here’s the real situation:  Your daughter or son is already doing heroin, do you want them to shoot up in a back alley at night with a possibly non-sterile needle, putting them at a high risk of contracting HIV, AIDS, or Hepatitis C; Or, would you rather they were committing substance abuse in a controlled environment like in that experimental clinic, where they can be directed to help and rehabilitation?

This essay is not supporting drug culture.  Drug abuse is a terrible problem that destroys lives, families, and communities.  But the current system is not working.  If we really want to tackle the drug problem we need to try a different approach.  That approach involves not penalizing the addicted, but treating them, it involves taking power out of the hands of criminals and trying new approaches to the drug epidemic that so affects our society.  It involves asking ourselves on a case by case basis how we legally, and societally should handle the problem of each addictive substance available on the black market.  The way we need to treat meth abuse will likely be very different from the way we treat marijuana.  But the way we treat addiction and people needs to be constant:  saving them from addiction, rather than punishing them.
