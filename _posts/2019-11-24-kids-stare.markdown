I've noticed-- as I'm sure you have-- that little kids like to stare.  I actually really like this about them, the non-verbal cues small children give off are more sincere and much less nuanced than the adult ones.  The kid is staring at you because they're curious, it's as simple as that (though if you're feeling insecure about it there's something on your face). Odds are someone's kid will probably stare you down at some point. I've always found it kind of funny, the innate confidence that a child possesses simply by being unaware of the societal rules and expectations surrounding them is pretty comical.

Naturally I'm not the only denizen of the internet to notice such a thing.  I searched `"why do kids stare"` and found an interesting [video](https://youtu.be/aR6pURirUCE), several articles on child development, and this hilariously sadistic Quora comment that seemed too funny not to share:

Ah. The internet.

I for one take comfort in the fact that kids are blatantly curious, it's their greatest quality.  And that guy sounds like a nutcase to me, so I would probably stare too.  Keep it up kid.
